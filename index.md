As a funded research project that aims to develop new social use for AR, the school of Computer Science seeks to create new prototypes and raise awareness of new ways to use AR. Our client is Joel Harman, he is a researcher at the Science and Engineering Faculty and School of Computer Science in QUT. Our industry partner is the QUT School of Computer Science. The goal is to develop a website that can host information related to AR and provide an online platform where prototypes can be demonstrated and explore the influence of AR on the social skill and beliefs of users, supporting the School of Computer Science to achieve their goal.

The project we delivered to our client is a website about the QUT AR project, which includes 6 different pages: Introduction, AR in Real Life, AR News, Contact, Team Omnipotent, and About Us. First of all, the Introduction page which host basic information about Augmented Reality and Augmented Sociality is create for user to understand the basic definition of Augmented Reality and difference between AR and AS. The AR in Real Life page aims at delivering the outcome of QUT AR project team to the costumer in a conceive and professional way, images and videos were also included in this page to demonstrate the project. The news about the Augment Reality in today’s world can be found on the AR News page with every news article is presented in blocks. Users can submit their feedback or further request of the project in contact page where a feedback form and contact information of the project owner is provided. The Team Omnipotent page contains information about the website development team while About Us page includes the profile information about the AR project team with a link to their QUT profile page.

My responsibilities in the capstone can be divided into two parts. The first part is team coordination. For example, collecting and arranging documents before weekly meetings with our client. Communicating with team members to update working progress to ensure the project can be completed timely. In addition, upload meeting notes and share important information on Trello to help team members keep up the pace. The second part is the individual working part. Release plans and user stories have been drafted and continuously updated after weekly meetings and customer requests. Meanwhile, I created the structure of the website and the draft of each page after discussing it with team members and the client.
