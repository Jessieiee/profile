My responsibilities in the capstone can be divided into two parts. The first part is team coordination. For example, collecting and arranging documents before weekly meetings with our client. Communicating with team members to update working progress to ensure the project can be completed timely. In addition, upload meeting notes and share important information on Trello to help team members keep up the pace. The second part is the individual working part. Release plans and user stories have been drafted and continuously updated after weekly meetings and customer requests. Meanwhile, I created the structure of the website and the draft of each page after discussing it with team members and the client.

I selected five of the most popular related companies and identified six areas that must be considered after communicating with clients. After collecting data from websites like Amazon and Google, a chart was utilized to display the results. Different colors were applied to display different situations, green denotes advantage exists and red represents weakness respectively.
